Author: Martina Toebe

Purpose: Learn about loops

Activity Instructions
Demonstrate your understanding of loops by completing the following individual checkpoint assignment.

Write a Python Program that does each of the following:

Use a while loop to ask the user for a positive number (>= 0). Continue asking as long as the number is negative, then display the number. For example:


Please type a positive number: -3
Sorry, that is a negative number. Please try again.
Please type a positive number: -8
Sorry, that is a negative number. Please try again.
Please type a positive number: -1
Sorry, that is a negative number. Please try again.
Please type a positive number: 12
The number is: 12
Use a while loop, to simulate a child asking their parent for a piece of candy. Have the program keep looping until the user answers "yes", then have the program output "Thank you." For example:


May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? yes
Thank you.
